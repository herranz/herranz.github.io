I'm Borja Herranz, and this is where I document my learning journey. 
Think of this space as my digital lab notebookâ€”where I tinker with robotics, electronics, photography, cooking, and 3D printing projects. 
I'm someone who gets excited by connections between different fields and loves learning through hands-on experimentation. Whether you're here to follow along with my builds, see what I'm currently figuring out, or just curious about maker projects, thanks for stopping by.
